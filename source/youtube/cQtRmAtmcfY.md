## Transcript

One of the other hard parts about today's ordeal was that it left behind so many witnesses. Hundreds of people here on campus and we spoke to a lot of them. New specialist Andrew Adams spoke to one of them actually who may have been one of the closest people to this shooting. Andrew, he was maybe 10 to 15 feet away from Charlie Kirk when he was shot. When we caught up with him tonight, he was still struggling with what he saw and what he felt it meant. out a whirlwind of of emotions. Hours into the aftermath of what was being called a political assassination. My head feels heavy. The feelings were still raw. I don't think I've ever seen someone die in front of me, let alone be murdered.

Skyler Baird says he'd always been a fan of Charlie Kirk. And when he learned the popular activist was in town, he wanted to get as close as he could. To my left is security. In the front of me is a security guard and then nothing else. Just Charlie. Baird says shortly after the topic turned to transgender mass shooters. I heard the loud crack. He believed he heard a gunshot and as soon as I thought that I saw Charlie's neck explode. Bear dove into the fountain. And in the hours since that time, he hasn't been able to escape the images of the shooting. I just like watched the video for like 10. It's like coming to terms with what happened has cut to his core. It's just like super positive experience and then someone ruins that.

Baird says he's since found some clarity. Story was that Charlie Kirk was murdered for his political views. And as everyone contemplates what's next, there's a cancer growing in our society. He hopes for reflection on where the country could be headed. You need to find love because as we move away from that and move into hostility, hate, and anger, society can't exist. Bar says he appreciated how Charlie Kirk fought for Christian values and how he made people feel comfortable living those values. He says he'll also always be remembered as someone who brought people to the table on difficult topics.

Back to you. That was one of the most powerful interviews I heard all day through this. Andrew, thank you.
