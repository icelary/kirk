## Correction

This was an exchange with left-wing political commentator [Cenk Uygur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenk_Uygur). The word interpreted as a slur was the name Cenk (pronounced _chenk_).

The incident occurred at Politicon 2018 during [a debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RIKm-cOdh0) between Charlie Kirk and Hasan Piker. Cenk was in the audience. Cenk's news program The Young Turks posted the clip with the description: "Charlie Kirk gets triggered by Cenk Uygur at Politicon 2018."
