[RCJ](https://einzelgaengerinmotte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/revision-controlled_journalism_v2.pdf) report on the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

## Incident

Charlie set up booths at college campuses and invited students to debate on any topic. On September 10, 2025, as the first stop in [The American Comeback Tour](https://www.americancomebacktour.com/), he was at [Utah Valley University](https://www.uvu.edu/) (UVU) in Orem, Utah.

A questioner approached the microphone and raised the topic of transgender mass shooters. They had a short exchange:

> Questioner: Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?  
> Kirk: Too many.  
> Questioner: Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?  
> Kirk: Counting or not counting gang violence?

At this point a shot was fired that hit Charlie Kirk in the neck. He was rushed to the hospital. Shortly after 2 PM, he was pronounced dead.
