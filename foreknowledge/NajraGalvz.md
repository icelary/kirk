These appear to have been doctored. It is unknown who originally produced them.

The photograph is from the account [@MKaylaUltra](https://archive.is/0iJXS). That account [had no public posts about Charlie Kirk](https://archive.is/US5Gz). @NajraGalvz [had retweeted one post](https://archive.is/sYG8w) from @MKaylaUltra unrelated to the shooting or Charlie Kirk.

## Account Parking

After the posts were spread, the user changed their username sometime on September 10. A good samaritan [grabbed the original username](https://archive.is/bL0Nn) to protect it against possible misuse.

> Username taken after the original owner changed their handle to prevent it being taken and used by scammers. My condolences to friends/family of Charlie Kirk.
